This project was part of my thesis at the university. The idea was to create a system that allows those interested in learning to fly to manage their shifts, reserve a plane, instructor and schedule at the aerodrome that best suits them in terms of availability and proximity.
The application in turn has 2 other modules, one for the instructor to accept or reject the class and evaluate the student and follow up and another module that is for the aerodromes where they register the planes they have available and upload the weather data. so that the student/instructor is aware and knows if the class should be rescheduled.
